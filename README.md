# Blinkit_On_PBI
This Power BI dashboard is a great starting point for beginners who want to learn the basics of DAX queries and data visualization. 
Using the Blinkit dataset, this project helps you understand key performance indicators (KPIs), business requirements, and how to derive meaningful insights through visuals.

While building this dashboard, you also get the opportunity to express your creativity. 
## However, making the dashboard visually attractive is secondary â€” understanding the data, extracting meaningful insights, and selecting the right visuals to communicate those insights should always come first.
This dashboard was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, but I customized it to better understand what stakeholders expect and how to think from a business perspective.

If you're just starting out with Power BI, give this project a try!
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions â€” letâ€™s learn and grow together. ðŸš€
